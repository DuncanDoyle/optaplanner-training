=== Lab 101: No more than 4 processes per computer

The customer's use case is closely resembles the OptaPlanner example CloudBalancing.
But there's 1 big difference:

* Don't assign many processes to the same computer

==== Preparation

. Import as a new project in your favorite IDE: `optaplanner-training-lab101/pom.xml`
. Create a new run configuration:
.. Main class: `org.optaplanner.examples.cloudbalancing.app.CloudBalancingApp`
.. VM parameters (optional): `-Xmx512M -server`
.. Working directory: `optaplanner-training-lab101` (this is the directory that contains the directory `data`)
. Run the run configuration.
.. _Quick open_ `4computer-12processes.xml`, _solve_ it and _terminate solving early_ after about 20 seconds.
.. Notice how the solution assigns 6 processes to computer 0:

.. Leave this window open to compare it later with your modified version.

==== Assignment

. Add a new hard constraint: no computer should have more than 4 processes assigned to it.

==== Success criteria

. _Open_ and _solve_ `4computer-12processes.xml`. It should no longer have a computer with more than 4 processes:

. _Open_ and _solve_ `100computer-300processes.xml`, in both the old and the new window. Compare the results.
.. Both solutions should become feasible (`0hard`).
.. The old window's soft score is clearly better because it has more flexibility.

==== Tips

* Add a new score rule in the file `cloudBalancingScoreRules.drl`. No other files require changes.
* Read up about http://docs.jboss.org/drools/release/latest/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#scoreTrap[score traps],
especially if `100computer-300processes.xml` does not become feasible.
