=== Solution Lab 101: No more than 4 processes per computer

==== Implementation

. Add this rule in the file +cloudBalancingScoreRules.drl+:
+
[source,drl]
----
rule "atMost4ProcessesPerComputer"
    when
      $computer : CloudComputer()
      $count : Number(intValue > 4) from accumulate(
          $c : CloudProcess(computer == $computer),
          count($c)
      )
    then
        scoreHolder.addHardConstraintMatch(kcontext, 4 - $count.intValue());
end
----

==== Pitfalls

A computer that has 6 processes is worse than a computer that has 5 processes.
The score function should reflect that, even if the customer's business analyst does not want to think
about any solution for which a computer has more than 4 computers (because it's an infeasible solution).

This code might trigger a http://docs.jboss.org/drools/release/latest/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#scoreTrap[score trap]:

  then
    scoreHolder.addHardConstraintMatch(kcontext, -1); // BAD: score trap
