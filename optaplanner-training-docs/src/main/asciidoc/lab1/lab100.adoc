=== Lab 100: Quick questions

==== Weighting the wishes of nurses

In a hospital we have these constraints:

* *Parenting nurses*: Nurses with children don't want to work on Wednesday afternoon.
* *Young nurses Saturday night*: Young nurses don't want to work on Saturday night.
** This is twice as important as the _Parenting nurses_ constraint.
* *Young nurses Sunday morning*: Young nurses don't want to work on Sunday morning.
** This is a third as important as the _Young nurses Saturday night_ constraint.
* *Double shift*: No nurse should work 2 shifts on the same day.
** This is more important than any other constraint, no matter how many times that other constraint is matched.

Specify the `ScoreDefinitionType` and determine the score weight and level of each constraint.

===== Solution

The `ScoreDefinitionType` is `HARD_SOFT` because we need 2 score levels.
The weight and level for each constraint:

* *Parenting nurses*: `-3soft`
* *Young nurses Saturday night*: `-6soft`
** Because `-3soft` times `2` is `-6soft`
* *Young nurses Sunday morning*: `-2soft`
** Because `-6soft` divided by `3` is `-2soft`
* *Double shift*: `-1hard`

Any multiple applied to all of the soft or hard numbers is fine too (for example `-30soft;-60soft;-20soft;-1hard`),
but it would increase the likeliness of overflow.

Using decimal or floating point numbers (for example `-1.5soft;-3.0soft;-1.0soft;-1hard`) is a bad idea:

* Decimal numbers (`BigDecimal`) heavily slow down the score calculation.
* Floating point numbers (`double` or `float`) cause http://docs.jboss.org/optaplanner/release/latest/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#avoidFloatingPointNumbersInScoreCalculation[errors].
