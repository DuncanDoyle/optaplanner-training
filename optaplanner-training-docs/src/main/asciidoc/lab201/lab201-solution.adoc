=== Solution Lab 201: Tennis friends

==== Class design

* What are the pigeons and what are the pigeons holes?
** Every Tuesday, there are 4 spots to fill. Over 18 weeks that makes 72 spots to fill.
*** Each of those spots, is a `TeamAssignment` instance. That class is the planning entity.
*** *A `TeamAssignment` is clearly defined* by a `Day` and an `indexInDay` (0, 1, 2 or 3). Those 2 properties are a unique business key, immutable during solving.
*** OptaPlanner's job is to find the best `Team` to schedule for each spot, so `TeamAssignment.getTeam()` is the planning variable (so definitely not immutable during solving).
*** Notice how `TeamAssignment` has a `ManyToOne` relationship to `Team`.
* Why is `TeamAssignment.getDay()` _not_ a planning variable?
** Despite that `TeamAssignment` has a `ManyToOne` relationship to `Day`, it makes a poor planning variable, because `Team` makes a poor business key (part).
** Even if the day is a planning variable, a `TeamAssignment` cannot fill in the `Team` field decidedly:
*** The number of times each team plays is unknown.
**** Some teams will play 10 days, others 11 days (because `18*4/7 = 10.29`), presuming the unavailability constraint allow this.
**** If the unavailability constraint is very disruptive, some teams might even only play 9 days or less, possibly even allowing others to play 12 days or more.
* Why not make both `TeamAssignment.getDay()` and `TeamAssignment.getTeam()` each a planning variable?
** Then what defines a `TeamAssignment`?
** This would blow up the search space a lot more. This impacts Solver speed a lot.
** The build-in fine grained moves might no longer suffice to get efficiently from feasible solution to feasible solution. This impacts Solver speed.

==== Search space size

`valueSize^entitySize^ = 7^72^ = 10^60^`

==== Number of constraint types

4 constraint types (score rules):

* oneAssignmentPerDatePerTeam (hard)
* unavailabilityPenalty (hard)
* fairAssignmentCountPerTeam (medium)
* evenlyConfrontationCount (soft)
